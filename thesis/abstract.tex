In this project, we explore Neural Networks and Random Forests machine learning 
models, to build a tool for making predictions and analysis on data coming from 
an undergraduate Computer Science course. The main reason for this is to 
automate the performance evaluation of students during the semester and help them 
to get higher grades if it is probable to fail the final exam. Aditionally, we 
propose a general structure for the dataset, so this model can be used for any 
Computer Science course.
